A few notes.

The ../../tls-example/gen program generates Certificates - both CA/Server and client

FIXED - was an issue with certs and keys not being overwritten
	THERE's SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PEM CERTS - GENERATE A PEM CERT BY CONVERTING THE RAW CERT TO PEM VIA SSL

	$ openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.raw -out certificate.pem
